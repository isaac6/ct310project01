<h1>Maah Daah Hey Trail</h1>
<p>
The Maah Daah Hey Trail is a 144-mile non-motorized single track trail that runs from USFS Burning Coal Vein Campground 30 miles south of Medora, to the USFS CCC campground 16 miles south of Watford City. The Trail winds through the Little Missouri National Grasslands in North Dakota's Badlands to form the longest continuous singletrack mountain biking trail in America. Nine fenced campgrounds are accessible by gravel surfaced roads. The campgrounds include camping spurs, potable water, hitching rails, picnic tables, fire rings and accessible toilets.
